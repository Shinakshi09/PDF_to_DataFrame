**Problem Statement**

Users have pdf files which contains investment details of a particular user.Since this data is contained inside pdf format, we need to convert it into machine readable format i.e into dataframes.

**Business perspective**

Once we have pdf data in machine readable format, we can perform further computations on the userâ€™s particular portfolio. For example: calculating portfolio beta, standard deviation, etc. and the user can have an overall summary about his portfolio in one go. 

**Process and library used**

I have user tabula library in order to read, extract data from pdf files which contains tables (table means which has boundaries).

**Dataset**

pdf file looks like following (can not share the file as it is confidential)
